Ministry to form panel to remedy CPA exam  
[영문뉴스] 2002년 11월 19일 (화) 18:18
The Ministry of Finance and Economy announced its plans yesterday to create a committee to reform the controversial CPA (certified public accountant) examination system.
Although CPAs will not be among the committee`s members, accountants say that the committee will in all likelihood tackle issues that have been previously raised by them with the ministry. 
Last year, the ministry mandated the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to create over 1,000 new CPAs - a first in Korea`s accounting history - citing the need to promote sound accounting practices industry wide. 
The government, however, apparently overlooked a law that requires a CPA to receive at least two years of practical training at a public accounting firm.
After realizing that, the FSS then suggested that firms listed on the Korea Stock Exchange accommodate the newly minted CPAs, but accountants rejected the idea.
"The main purpose of selecting more CPAs is to ensure transparent accounting," said Yoon Jong-wook, head of the CPAs` own committee for improving training conditions.
"If accountants are pushed into regular companies for training, they will fail to be trained as professionals, and also be influenced by the CEOs when carrying out audits," he said.
The committee has staged numerous strikes outside the FSS building after discovering that 412 out of the 966 CPAs selected this year are still in search of training positions.
The FSS, meanwhile, insists that they are under no obligation to find suitable training positions for the CPAs, and have left that responsibility up to the finance ministry.
The ministry expects the newly launched committee to submit a proposal for overhauling the CPA exam system by year`s end.
